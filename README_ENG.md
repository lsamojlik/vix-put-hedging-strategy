<b>
Dynamic Market Rallies and Euphoria – Is It a Signal for a Drop? Should You Hedge Your Portfolio?</b>

</div>

________________________________________
Study Assumptions:

• Many long-term investors face a dilemma: on one hand, they do not want to realize profits and sell stocks they believe in; on the other hand, they fear short-term corrections. A possible solution is hedging, i.e., short-term portfolio protection using derivatives – e.g., VIX futures or S&P 500 put options.

• Data: S&P 500 (from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paveljurke/s-and-p-500-gspc-historical-data?resource=download
) and VIX (source: Yahoo Finance, yfinance library).

• Study period: 01.01.1990 – 30.10.2025

• Analysis horizons: 2 weeks = 10 trading days; 1 month = 20 trading days; 3 months = 60 trading days.

• The analysis focuses on short-term portfolio protection; therefore, changes in the S&P 500 index and the VIX are examined 10, 20, and 60 days ahead.

Summary

1. Market euphoria does not necessarily indicate an imminent correction. Data shows that the market often continues to rise despite low VIX levels. If a bull market is ongoing and VIX remains low – do not automatically interpret this as a signal of an end to the uptrend.

2. After periods of strong market gains in a low-VIX environment, the probability of increased volatility rises, but not necessarily broad market declines. Nevertheless, analyzing VIX behavior relative to the distance of the S&P 500 from moving averages (SMA) does not confirm a clear relationship between trend direction (bull/bear) and volatility level. The VIX does not “predict” trends but reacts to rising uncertainty and sudden changes in investor expectations.

3. The most predictable VIX “spikes” precede events that can change the market narrative – such as FOMC meetings, macroeconomic data releases, or monetary policy decisions. Increased demand for options hedging against these events pushes up their prices, thereby driving up the VIX.

4. VIX changes are therefore more sensitive to informational and emotional risks than to the stock market cycle itself. This means that even in the middle of a bull market, VIX can temporarily rise – not because the market is collapsing, but because investors temporarily increase hedging levels.

5. Instead of exiting the market, investors can temporarily hedge the portfolio:

- with a VIX contract (for sudden volatility spikes),

- with an S&P 500 put option (for a longer correction).

6. Hedging costs are real but serve as a type of “insurance” – allowing investors to maintain exposure to the stocks they believe in long-term without selling them. It is better to prepare a short-term hedging strategy than to exit the market in panic.

7. Hedging is not a tool for earning profits but a part of investment discipline. Its main goal is to limit potential losses, maintain strategy, and reduce emotional reactions, not to improve returns.
